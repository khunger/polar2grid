Software Design
---------------

Polar2Grid has a modular design operating on the idea of satellite “products”
or "datasets"; data observed by a satellite instrument. These products can be
any type of raster data, such as temperatures, reflectances, radiances, or
any other value that may be recorded by or calculated from an instrument.
There are 4 main steps or components involved when working with these
products in Polar2Grid:
reading, writing, compositing, and remapping.
Polar2Grid makes it possible to access and configure these steps via simple
bash scripts. The script that "glues" these steps together is
``polar2grid.sh`` and creates gridded versions of the user swath products
provided to it. More information on accessing Polar2Grid's features and
running its scripts can be found in the :doc:`getting_started` section
or the examples following each reader section. Note that although an
example may be written for a specific reader the same operations can
be applied to all readers unless mentioned otherwise.

For more low-level information on the design and responsibility of each
component see the :doc:`design_overview` Appendix.

    digraph glue_flow {
        rankdir = LR;
        node [shape = rectangle, fillcolor="#C3DCE7:white", gradientangle="90.0", style="filled"];
        "Reader" -> "Remapper";
        "Remapper" -> "Writer";
        "Remapper" -> "Compositors" [style=dashed];
        "Compositors" -> "Writer" [style=dashed];
    }

.. note::

    Compositors and how they are configured will be changing in future
    versions of Polar2Grid. Due to this they are no longer documented here.
